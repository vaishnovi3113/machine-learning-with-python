What is machine learning? why machine learning?
   Well it is subset of AI that can learn to perform a task with extracted or collected data.The tasks include predictions and effective classification.

supervised and unsupervised learning algorithms:- * these are 2 of the categories of ML algorithms

supervised learning algorithms - these algorithm makes predictions or estimates of output by using labeled data.
----> now, what is labeled data?
      labeled data consits of
       features - features refer to the input variables.These features can be numerical, categorical, or a combination of both.
       labels   - labels refer to the output value that the model is being trained to predict.
 Examples of Supervised Learning Algorithms:
   * Linear Regression
   * Logistic Regression       

unsupervised learning algorithms - unsupervised learning algorithms are designed to analyze and model data without using labeled data.
Examples of Supervised Learning Algorithms:
   * Clustering algorithm
   * principal component analysis
